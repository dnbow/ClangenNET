    ClanCeremony.App1: "m_c has reached the age of six moons and has been made an apprentice, with (mentor) as {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mentor."
    ClanCeremony.App2: "Newly-made apprentice, m_c, touches noses with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new mentor, (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App3: "m_c carefully touches noses with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new mentor, (mentor), looking quite intimidated and nervous."

    ClanCeremony.App5: "m_c strides up to {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new mentor, looking very proud and excited to be apprenticed to (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App6: "In {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eagerness, m_c accidentally shoves {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} nose into (mentor)'s so hard that (mentor) flinches back in surprise. m_c sheepishly apologizes, and the two have a good laugh about it."
    ClanCeremony.App7: "(mentor) sees how nervous m_c is and whispers a quiet encouragement to {PRONOUN/m_c/object} as they touch noses, promising to be a good mentor to {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.App8: "m_c touches noses with (mentor), wondering whether this is truly the right path for {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.App9: "m_c remains calm as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/touch/touches} noses with (mentor), but {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} twitching tail gives away how excited {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} truly {VERB/m_c/are/is}."
    ClanCeremony.App10: "m_c can't seem to sit still as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/bounce/bounces} up to touch noses with (mentor), swearing {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll be the best warrior the Clan has ever seen."
    ClanCeremony.App11: "m_c sits up straighter as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} called forward to be made an apprentice. While {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/try/tries} to look calm and collected, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} still {VERB/m_c/tremble/trembles} a bit as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/touch/touches} noses with (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App12: "Almost immediately after m_c touches noses with (mentor), {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/start/starts} asking about when they're going to go out and explore the territory."
    ClanCeremony.App13: "m_c fidgets impatiently beside (mentor) as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/wait/waits} for the meeting to end. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} finally an apprentice! {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/want/wants} to hurry up, get out there, and go, go, go!"
    ClanCeremony.App14: "Newly-made apprentice m_c wishes {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} had someone to mentor {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.App15: "m_c isn't confident in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ability to train {PRONOUN/m_c/self}, but will try anyway."
    ClanCeremony.App16: "m_c is frustrated that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/don't/doesn't} have a mentor."
    ClanCeremony.App17: "m_c isn't sure what to do without the guidance of a mentor."
    ClanCeremony.App18: "m_c wonders if {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} can get by without the guidance of a mentor."
    ClanCeremony.App19: "m_c is so, so very excited to finally have a mentor, solidifying {PRONOUN/m_c/object} as part of the Clan. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} grateful to be here, really... but (mentor) can't replace the parent who gave {PRONOUN/m_c/object} to this Clan, the parent who should've been here chanting {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} name."
    ClanCeremony.App20: "As m_c touches noses with (mentor), {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/hope/hopes} that {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject}'ll be a cool mentor that won't assign boring tasks. Anything but gathering moss or tick duty!"
    ClanCeremony.App21: "(old_name) sits in front of the Clan with pride, {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} tiny heart beating so fast {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/think/thinks} it might explode! {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} very excitedly {VERB/m_c/touch/touches} noses with (mentor), happy to start {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} apprenticeship."
    ClanCeremony.App22: "Surprising (mentor), the first thing that m_c does after {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} apprentice ceremony is gather moss, just to make sure everyone has fresh bedding."
    ClanCeremony.App23: "m_c touches noses with (mentor) and hopes that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll get to hunt first, so {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} can make sure the Clan is fed."
    ClanCeremony.App24: "Eager to learn the best ways to help {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clan thrive, m_c excitedly touches noses with (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App25: "m_c purrs so hard that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} shaking as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/touch/touches} noses with (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App26: "m_c silently swears to StarClan to do {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} best for the Clan as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/touch/touches} noses with (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App27: "As m_c touches noses with (mentor), {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/hope/hopes} {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll get to do something that will really impress the Clan on {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} first day. Maybe {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} could catch a big, fat rabbit? Or chase off a fox! That'll show the Clan {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} the best apprentice anyone's ever seen!"
    ClanCeremony.App28: "m_c sits excitedly beside (mentor) as the meeting ends, and hopes {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll be doing something exciting like battle training first. {PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} claws are itching to tear at something."
    ClanCeremony.App29: "m_c touches noses with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mentor, (mentor), looking bored and unimpressed. But on the inside, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} bouncing around with euphoria as if {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was} still a kit!"
    ClanCeremony.App30: "m_c has been pestering everyone for moons on when {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} finally {VERB/m_c/get/gets} to be an apprentice, and everyone is relieved that they're finally free of the young cat's nagging... Until {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/start/starts} asking about when {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} going to be a warrior as soon as the meeting ends."
    ClanCeremony.App31: "As {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mentor is about to be chosen, m_c interrupts and announces {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/want/wants} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mentor to be (mentor). {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/stride/strides} forward with confidence to touch noses with (mentor) when it's allowed."
    ClanCeremony.App32: "m_c can't believe {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} apprenticeship is finally here! Nearly tripping over {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} own paws, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/scurry/scurries} up to (mentor), excitedly touching noses with {PRONOUN/(mentor)/object}."
    ClanCeremony.App33: "Newly apprenticed m_c can't help but squeak when {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mentor's name is announced, and {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/run/runs} with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} tail tucked between {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} legs in embarrassment to touch noses with (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App34: "The Clan gathers around and urges (old_name) to go to the front of the crowd. Not having a leader isn't an excuse to force a cat to stay in the nursery when they're six moons old. (old_name) is renamed m_c, and the Clan votes to make (mentor) {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mentor."
    ClanCeremony.App35: "The Clan cheers for the new apprentice, m_c. They allow {PRONOUN/m_c/object} to choose {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} own mentor, and m_c chooses (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App36: "With m_c's apprentice ceremony completed, there's still the problem of figuring out who will mentor {PRONOUN/m_c/object}. (mentor) steps forward and offers to mentor {PRONOUN/m_c/object} first, and m_c touches noses with {PRONOUN/(mentor)/object}."
    ClanCeremony.App37: "p1 is watching with pride as m_c is named and given to (mentor) to apprentice under. {PRONOUN/p1/subject/CAP} know that (mentor) was a good choice."
    ClanCeremony.App38: "(old_name) loudly complains as p1 pulls {PRONOUN/m_c/object} over to quickly groom {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} pelt. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/manage/manages} to wriggle away and scurry off to the front of the crowd for {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ceremony, where {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} renamed to m_c and apprenticed to (mentor). "
    ClanCeremony.App39: "Even though {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} excited to finally be made an apprentice, it takes a bit of coaxing by p1 for (old_name) to step forward for {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ceremony. p1 watches in pride as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} named m_c and {VERB/m_c/touch/touches} noses with (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App40: "m_c hopes that dead_par1 is watching in pride from StarClan as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} apprenticed to (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App41: "m_c wishes that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} could be happier about being made an apprentice as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/touch/touches} noses with (mentor), but all {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} can think about is how much {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/wish/wishes} that dead_par1 was still there to chant {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} name with the rest of the Clan."
    ClanCeremony.App42: "m_c tries to keep up a brave face as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} apprenticed to (mentor), but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/keep/keeps} stealing glances at the crowd, as if trying to find dead_par1 despite knowing {PRONOUN/dead_par1/subject}{VERB/dead_par1/'re/'s} no longer with them."
    ClanCeremony.App43: "m_c sits beside {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new mentor, (mentor), as the meeting comes to a close. {PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} claws dig into the ground as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/glare/glares} up at the sky, wondering why dead_par1 couldn't be there with {PRONOUN/m_c/object} at such an important moment."
    ClanCeremony.App44: "m_c smiles up at the stars as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/sit/sits} beside (mentor). The stars seem to shine brighter, and m_c knows it's a sign that dead_par1 is still watching over {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.App45: "As m_c touches noses with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new mentor, (mentor), {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/make/makes} a silent promise to dead_par1 to make {PRONOUN/dead_par1/object} proud, and to take care of the Clan in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} parent's absence."
    ClanCeremony.App46: "(old_name) runs up to the front of the crowd, eager to get {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new name. When {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} called m_c for the first time, p1 and p2's voices can be heard the loudest as the Clan welcomes the new apprentice."
    ClanCeremony.App47: "m_c hopes that dead_par1 and dead_par2 are watching in pride from StarClan as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} apprenticed to (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.App48: "m_c wishes that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} could be happier about being made an apprentice as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/touch/touches} noses with (mentor), but all {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} can think about is how much {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/wish/wishes} that dead_par1 and dead_par2 were still there to chant {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} name with the rest of the Clan."
    ClanCeremony.App49: "m_c tries to keep up a brave face as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} apprenticed to (mentor), but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/keep/keeps} stealing glances at the crowd, as if trying to find dead_par1 and dead_par2 despite knowing they're no longer with {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.App50: "m_c sits beside {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new mentor, (mentor), as the meeting comes to a close. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} claws dig into the ground as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/glare/glares} up at the sky, wondering why dead_par1 and dead_par2 couldn't be there with {PRONOUN/m_c/object} at such an important moment."
    ClanCeremony.App51: "m_c smiles up at the stars as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/sit/sits} beside (mentor). The stars seem to shine brighter, and m_c knows it's a sign that dead_par1 and dead_par2 are still watching over {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.App52: "As m_c touches noses with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new mentor, (mentor), {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/make/makes} a silent promise to dead_par1 and dead_par2 to make them proud, and to take care of the Clan in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} parent's absence."
    ClanCeremony.App53: "(mentor) calls a meeting. {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject/CAP} {VERB/(mentor)/have/has} been watching (old_name) for a while now, and {VERB/(mentor)/have/has} decided to mentor {PRONOUN/m_c/object} personally. m_c's eyes shine with pride. "
    ClanCeremony.App54: "(old_name) has always wished to be the hero of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clan, a warrior admired by all. (mentor) hopes, while m_c touches noses with {PRONOUN/(mentor)/object}, that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} going to stay wary of the dangers of their territory and not endanger {PRONOUN/m_c/self}."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp0: "(old_name), like every young kit, had dreams of becoming a warrior from a young age. However, as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} grew older, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} knew that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} destiny lay in the medicine den. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} happily {VERB/m_c/take/takes} up {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new place as a medicine cat apprentice - looking forward to healing {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clanmates for many moons to come."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp1: "m_c has decided that hunting and fighting is not the way {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/want/wants} to provide for {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clan. Instead, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/have/has} chosen to serve {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clan by healing and communing with StarClan. (mentor) proudly becomes {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mentor."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp2: "Interested in herbs even in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} kithood, m_c is eager to be apprenticed to (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp3: "Interested in all the myths and stories told by the elders and queens, m_c decides to become a medicine cat apprentice, hoping to someday speak to those gone before. (mentor) loves {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} determination and eagerness to learn, and agrees to take {PRONOUN/m_c/object} on as {PRONOUN/(mentor)/poss} apprentice."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp4: "The thought alone of fighting and hurting another cat makes m_c shiver. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/decide/decides} to heal instead of fight, and (mentor) takes {PRONOUN/m_c/object} under {PRONOUN/(mentor)/poss} wing."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp5: "Wanting to stand out among {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clanmates more, m_c decides to become a medicine cat, and is apprenticed to (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp6: "To gain access to both life-saving herbs and life-threatening poisons, m_c decides to become a medicine cat, and is apprenticed to (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp7: "Worried {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} may not be good as a hunter or fighter, but still wanting to make {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clan proud somehow, m_c decides to become a medicine cat apprentice under (mentor)."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp8: "(mentor) stands before the Clan and announces that {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject} won't be there forever, and it is time {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject} took on an apprentice. {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject/CAP} {VERB/(mentor)/tell/tells} the Clan that {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject} {VERB/(mentor)/have/has} chosen (old_name), now m_c, to be {PRONOUN/(mentor)/poss} new apprentice."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp9: "(mentor) has no doubts in {PRONOUN/(mentor)/poss} mind of who {PRONOUN/(mentor)/poss} new apprentice will be. (old_name) has always been looking for an excuse to be in {PRONOUN/(mentor)/poss} den, asking endless questions about what each herb is and what it's used for. And as (mentor) announces that the newly named m_c will be {PRONOUN/(mentor)/poss} apprentice, {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject} {VERB/(mentor)/see/sees} m_c's eyes shining in delight and excitement, and knows {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject} {VERB/(mentor)/were/was} right in choosing {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp10: "Newly-made medicine cat apprentice m_c learns the way of healing through guidance from StarClan."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp11: "StarClan speaks: the new medicine cat apprentice shall be m_c. m_c is unsure if {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} ready for the role without a mentor, but the stars promise to guide {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp12: "The Clan needs a new medicine cat, and m_c is chosen for the role. m_c is stunned that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was} chosen, but agrees anyway, knowing how badly the Clan needs a medicine cat."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp13: "m_c has decided that hunting and fighting is not the way {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/want/wants} to provide for {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clan. Instead, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/have/has} chosen to serve {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clan by healing and communing with StarClan - who will be the ones to train {PRONOUN/m_c/object} in the absence of a proper mentor."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp14: "Interested in herbs even in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} kithood, m_c is eager to be made the new medicine cat apprentice, and learn how to heal from those who came before {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp15: "The thought alone of fighting and hurting another cat makes m_c shiver. Knowing the Clan needs a medicine cat, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/seize/seizes} the chance to do good for the Clan without harming others. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/take/takes} on the role of medicine cat apprentice."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp16: "Knowing the Clan is in desperate need of a medicine cat, and wanting to do something to stand out and do something more important, m_c announces mid-meeting that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/want/wants} to be the new medicine cat apprentice."

    ClanCeremony.MedApp18: "As the new medicine cat apprentice, m_c dreams of StarClan for the first time. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/are/is} greeted by many StarClan cats, one of which {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/recognize/recognizes} as dead_par1, who is watching in pride as the rest of StarClan's ranks accept the new medicine cat apprentice."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp19: "m_c decides to become a medicine cat apprentice in hopes that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} will be able to see dead_par1 and dead_par2 in StarClan."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp20: "As the new medicine cat apprentice, m_c dreams of StarClan for the first time. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/are/is} greeted by many StarClan cats, two of which {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/recognize/recognizes} as dead_par1 and dead_par2, who are watching in pride as the rest of StarClan's ranks accept the new medicine cat apprentice."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp21: "m_c has been looking and wondering about the mysteries of the stars ever since {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} first opened {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes. (mentor) promises {PRONOUN/m_c/object} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} own place amongst them as a full medicine cat one day."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp22: "m_c sees no reason to sully {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} claws with blood, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} far more interested in the knowledge and wisdom that can be gained by a medicine cat apprentice. (mentor) promises to teach {PRONOUN/m_c/object} all {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject} {VERB/(mentor)/know/knows} and they go into the medicine den together immediately after the ceremony."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp23: "m_c has been wondering and pondering about the mysteries of life and the meaning of it all. (mentor) is eager to start teaching {PRONOUN/m_c/object}; {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/sound/sounds} like a delight to work with!"
    ClanCeremony.MedApp24: "m_c was never interested in fighting and decided to devote {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} life to healing and helping all kinds of cats in any way {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} can. (mentor) is almost awed when {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject} {VERB/(mentor)/see/sees} the determination and love m_c feels for all the cats that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/meet/meets} and is extremely proud to become {PRONOUN/(mentor)/poss} mentor."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp25: "After m_c touches noses with (mentor), {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} immediately {VERB/m_c/run/runs} towards the medicine den boasting that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} will be the best medicine cat any Clan has ever seen."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp26: "Right after {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} medicine cat apprentice ceremony, m_c declares that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} won't hesitate to tell (mentor) if {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject}{VERB/(mentor)/'ve/'s} being a mousebrain. All the other cats immediately gasp and look (mentor)'s reaction and relax as {PRONOUN/(mentor)/subject} only {VERB/(mentor)/laugh/laughs} and says that m_c better prove that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/have/has} the skills to back that up."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp27: "While m_c does not really like other cats, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/dislike/dislikes} fighting even more. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/prefer/prefers} a more cunning approach and being a medicine cat gives {PRONOUN/m_c/object} the opportunity to do so. (mentor) takes {PRONOUN/m_c/object} on as apprentice, admiring {PRONOUN/m_c/object} sharp tongue and the cunning gleam in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes."
    ClanCeremony.MedApp28: "m_c has always longed for adventures and {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/feel/feels} like being a medicine cat apprentice will be the greatest adventure of them all. (mentor) eagerly accepts such an eager and willing apprentice."

    ClanCeremony.Med11: "As much as the warrior apprentices teased, (old_name) knew the truth. There is so much to see and do as a full medicine cat, and m_c could hardly wait to get started, almost charging off before {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ceremony ended."
    ClanCeremony.Med12: "Helping cats heal is what (old_name) does best. {PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} full name of m_c proves to the Clan that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} fully qualified to do so, and that StarClan has accepted {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ClanCeremony.Med13: "As {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/take/takes} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} first steps into being a full medicine cat, (old_name) quietly reflects that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} might just have the most powerful position in the Clan, now that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} m_c. StarClan itself has accepted {PRONOUN/m_c/object}, speaks through {PRONOUN/m_c/object}, and m_c will remember this."

    ClanCeremony.Med15: "(old_name) may have butted heads against nearly every Clan member {PRONOUN/m_c/object} {VERB/m_c/have/has}, but being able to argue was a blessing as a medicine cat, as m_c will have to continue shoving odd mixtures down everyone's throat. StarClan will be watching {PRONOUN/m_c/object} with pride."
    ClanCeremony.Med16: "(old_name) has proven {PRONOUN/m_c/self} to have one of the most invaluable traits a medicine cat can have - a level head under pressure. The stars of Silverpelt twinkle in joy and acceptance as m_c receives {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} full name and duties as a medicine cat."
    ClanCeremony.Med17: "It is (old_name)'s attention to detail that earns {PRONOUN/m_c/object} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} medicine cat name of m_c. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} will serve the Clan long and well, with no one doubting {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} skill and knowledge of herbs {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'ve/'s} spent so many moons learning."
    ClanCeremony.Med18: "(old_name)'s charming attitude does as much for {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} patients as {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} skill does. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} will continue to heal with words and herbs as m_c now that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} a full medicine cat of c_n."
    ClanCeremony.Med19: "Though {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} actions may come off as lighthearted, (old_name) has worked hard to earn {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} name of m_c, and mews that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll protect c_n as a medicine cat. Though {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/start/starts} giggling right after {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/say/says} it, causing a few purrs of amusement from onlookers both here, and in StarClan."

No one doubts that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} will be well suited to the heartbreaks that wait for all medicine cats."
    ClanCeremony.Med21: "Excellent medicine cats have as much heart as they do brains, and (old_name) proves {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/have/has} both by the time {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/earn/earns} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} name of m_c, proving a gentle touch does as much good as the right herbs."

    ClanCeremony.Med23: "(old_name)'s methods are a little unconventional, but it's hard to argue with results, and (old_name) gets results. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/gain/gains} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} medicine cat name of m_c, and the eldest medicine cat in the Clans warns {PRONOUN/m_c/object} not to do anything too risky."
    ClanCeremony.Med24: "There's so much pain that c_n has to endure, and (old_name) has decided to heal it all, no matter the cost. StarClan has accepted {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} passion, and supports {PRONOUN/m_c/object} with the name of m_c, hoping that they can help ease some of the burden m_c placed on {PRONOUN/m_c/self}."
    ClanCeremony.Med25: "(old_name) has known that StarClan has been watching over {PRONOUN/m_c/object} since {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} started {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} apprenticeship. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/are/is} given the name m_c in honor of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} faith.

    ClanCeremony.Med26: "During {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} apprenticeship (old_name) struggled with the best way to protect c_n, with teeth or with tinctures, but now that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} m_c, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} certain {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'ve/'s} made the right choice to be a medicine cat. Though {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} will keep practicing that battle move {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'ve/'s} learned, just in case."
    ClanCeremony.Med27: "As the end of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} apprenticeship nears, (old_name) is worried StarClan won't accept {PRONOUN/m_c/object} as a full medicine cat. However, the ceremony plays out without a hitch, and m_c is honored as a skilled medicine cat."
    ClanCeremony.Med28: "While the rest of the Clan may not understand it (old_name) enjoys {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} time alone in the medicine den. In fact, now that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} m_c, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} can't wait to get back to it, and away from the center of attention."
    ClanCeremony.Med29: "Healing a sprain, comforting a bruised kit, soothing a sore elder - all of these things give (old_name) meaning in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} life as a medicine cat. StarClan honors {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} caring heart with the name m_c."
    ClanCeremony.Med30: "c_n has raised and cared for (old_name), and (old_name) wants nothing more but to do the same, taking on the name m_c as a full medicine cat of c_n. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} will be thinking of how to care for c_n until the day {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/depart/departs} for StarClan, and maybe even after."
    ClanCeremony.Med31: "(old_name) knows all the herbs, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/know/knows} how to treat rat bites, but surely {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/need/needs} to learn more? StarClan assures {PRONOUN/m_c/object} that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll do fine, and gives {PRONOUN/m_c/object} the name m_c as a sign of trust, even if m_c is sure it's still too soon."
    ClanCeremony.Med32: "It is (old_name)'s willingness to sit and listen that assures the other medicine cats it's time to give {PRONOUN/m_c/object} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} name of m_c. m_c thanks them graciously and tucks {PRONOUN/m_c/self} back down to listen to the next cat speak."
    ClanCeremony.Med33: "No one knows how (old_name) got {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} claws on it, but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/manage/manages} to play with a shiny piece of Twoleg stuff during {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} entire medicine cat ceremony. When asked why, m_c replied that one of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} patients might like it, and {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} wanted to make sure it was safe."
    ClanCeremony.Med34: "(old_name) always owns up to {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mistakes, and puts the work in to fix them, but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} still surprised when {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/get/gets} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} medicine cat name of m_c. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/promise/promises} to work twice as hard to be worthy of it."

StarClan protect them, StarClan protect all of them, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/hope/hopes} {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll receive more guidance in the moons ahead."
    ClanCeremony.Med36: "(old_name) blurts out {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} new medicine cat name of m_c, cutting off the words of the ceremony mid-meow, not surprising anyone. There's no arguing with m_c, so the other medicine cats cheer for {PRONOUN/m_c/object}, through purrs of amusement."
    ClanCeremony.Med37: "(old_name)'s eyes glint as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/get/gets} the medicine cat name of m_c. No one seems to notice that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/don't/didn't} agree to all of the vows of being a medicine cat, instead only nodding at some, and agreeing to others with a meow."
    ClanCeremony.Med38: "No one knows why (old_name) brought a mossball to {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} medicine cat naming ceremony. StarClan grants {PRONOUN/m_c/object} the name m_c all the same, welcoming {PRONOUN/m_c/object} into the full mysteries of StarClan."
    ClanCeremony.Med39: "The way (old_name) is sitting is so stiff you could use {PRONOUN/m_c/object} as reinforcement for the camp walls.

    ClanCeremony.Med40: "Even though this is {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} medicine cat naming ceremony, (old_name) can only think about {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} Clanmates back at camp, and asks if {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} can return early after {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/get/gets} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} name of m_c."
    ClanCeremony.Med41: "StarClan honors the way (old_name) always goes the extra step to do {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} best as a medicine cat, and gives {PRONOUN/m_c/object} the name m_c, knowing that m_c will continue to do {PRONOUN/m_c/object} best."
    ClanCeremony.Med42: "This is a serious time for (old_name), {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} medicine cat naming ceremony! Naturally, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} cracking jokes and being irreverent right up until the moment {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/get/gets} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} name, m_c, and only quiets down long enough to think of something funny to add."
    ClanCeremony.Med43: "The other medicine cats mistake it as being calm, but (old_name) isn't quiet because {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} at peace, but because {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} angry. Every snide remark, every time someone sneered at {PRONOUN/m_c/object}, every time {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was} treated less than, all of it goes through {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mind. Now that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} m_c, c_n better treat {PRONOUN/m_c/object} with respect, or there will be consequences."
    ClanCeremony.Med44: "Medicine cat training had just felt right for (old_name), more like remembering then learning, like {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} had done this before.

    ClanCeremony.Warrior39: "(old_name) is still messy after tussling with someone else, and doesn't even bother to groom {PRONOUN/m_c/self} before trotting up to the front of the crowd. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/are/is} named m_c, and honored for {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} r_h."
    ClanCeremony.Warrior40: "(old_name) pads forward silently before sitting in front of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leader. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/remain/remains} as quiet as {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} steps forward for l_n to name {PRONOUN/m_c/object} m_c and honor {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} r_h."

    ClanCeremony.Warrior42: "(old_name) grumbles to {PRONOUN/m_c/self} as l_n changes just a single word in the ceremony. But {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/know/knows} better than to correct {PRONOUN/l_n/object} during such an important ceremony. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} can speak to l_n about it later. For now, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/listen/listens} as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} given the name m_c, and {VERB/m_c/are/is} honored for {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} r_h."
    ClanCeremony.Warrior43: "l_n hops up onto the meeting spot to find that (old_name) has set moss along it in preparation for the meeting so that l_n can be more comfortable through the long ceremony. Purring, l_n gives {PRONOUN/m_c/object} the name m_c for {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} r_h."

    ClanCeremony.Warrior45: "(old_name)'s penchant for getting into, and even starting, trouble has almost made l_n hold back on making {PRONOUN/m_c/object} a warrior. However, l_n can tell that (old_name) has been trying really hard lately to make up for it, and it would feel cruel to make {PRONOUN/m_c/object} wait any longer. So, l_n names {PRONOUN/m_c/object} m_c in honor of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} r_h."
    ClanCeremony.Warrior46: "As (old_name) takes {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} vow and is named m_c after {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} r_h, {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} thoughts are less on protecting the Clan, and more so on ensuring that anyone who harms it will pay in kind."
    ClanCeremony.Warrior47: "(old_name)'s advice has helped many cats throughout {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} days as an apprentice.

    ClanCeremony.Mediator4: "(previous_mentor) tells l_n that (old_name) has completed {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mediator training, and l_n gives {PRONOUN/m_c/object} the name m_c after {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} r_h, welcoming {PRONOUN/m_c/object} as the Clan's new mediator."

    DeathEvent.Clan: "They've lost their life and travelled to [Dead.Afterlife]"

    # Beach
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice0: "m_c had not realized {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} fatal mistake until {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} felt {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} paws get clammy and {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} blood, once burning hot and dry after being out in the sun with no water nor shade, turned cold. As the world turned right-side up and {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} consciousness faded right before {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes, m_c knew {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was}beyond saving, as dehydration and overheating claimed the last bits of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} strength."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice1: "r_c noticed m_c hadn't shown up for training again, yet after further prodding realized {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} hadn't been at camp for a few days. However, r_c never expected to find m_c like this: dead and dried out, their tattered pelt lifeless and dull."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice2: "r_c realizes {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/haven't/hasn't} seen m_c around camp for a few days. Checking {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} favorite spots yields nothing, so r_c decides to go out and search for {PRONOUN/m_c/object} in the Clans' territory. However, r_c could never have expected to find m_c's shriveled-up body, clearly dead for some time now."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice3: "r_c is frantic with worry; m_c, {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} child, hadn't been seen around camp, no matter who {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} asked and where {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} searched. It's not until r_c stumbles across m_c's body, withered under the sun, that, with a despairing sound, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/realize/realizes} {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} greatest fears have come true."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice4: "m_c couldn't speak, yell for help, or beg StarClan to give {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} a sign they were still with {PRONOUN/m_c/object}, {PRONOUN/m_c/poss}  tongue having swelled up inside {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} dried mouth. As m_c collapses, feeling {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} body internally shut down because of dehydration and heat exhaustion, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} pray that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} clanmates locate m_c's body before {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} become unrecognizable under the sun."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice5: "m_c knew {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} made a mistake, as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} felt {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} last bits of strength slip away from {PRONOUN/m_c/object} and {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} heart stopped beating. {PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} body only discovered days later, r_c wailing at the shriveled body of {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} apprentice, who succumbed to heat and dehydration."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice6: "It was purely accidental that r_c stumbled across m_c's decaying body in the sunlight, simply hoping to stretch {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} paws outside of camp. Now, r_c must explain to m_c's remaining family or friends that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/are/is} never returning home, having been caught unprepared under the treacherous sun."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice7: "m_c  never meant to meet StarClan this way, rotting away under the sun after fainting from dehydration, heat exhaustion, and overexertion. r_c tragically discovers {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} body, unable to stop {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} desperate wails at the site of {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} child's body."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice8: "r_c's mournful sounds pierced through c_n's territory as {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} stumble on the lifeless, decaying corpse of m_c. m_c had disappeared from camp days ago, having not returned, but only now did r_c understand why  {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} child didn't come back home; m_c was caught out in the treacherous sun, ill-prepared, succumbing to dehydration and exhaustion."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice9: "m_c asked r_c to meet them at their unique spot, which r_c readily accepted and journeyed through the territory. Yet, with a heartbroken sound that clawed its way out of r_c's throat, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/stumble/stumbles} upon m_c's body, passing from dehydration; r_c curses m_c for tainting what could have been a good memory of {PRONOUN/r_c/inposs}."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice10: "m_c asked r_c to meet them at their unique spot, which r_c readily accepted and journeyed through the territory. Yet, with a heartbroken sound that clawed its way out of r_c's throat, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/stumble/stumbles} upon m_c's body, passing from dehydration."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Apprentice11: "m_c had invited r_c out days earlier, aiming to train and grow closer together. However, when r_c arrived, m_c never showed up; m_c wasn't seen around camp, nor had {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} been to training. It wasn't until r_c stumbles upon {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} body, the former succumbing to dehydration and exhaustion, that {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} understands why."
    DeathEvent.Beach.General0: "m_c was washed out to sea, never to be seen again."
    DeathEvent.Beach.General1: "m_c was poisoned by a sea creature and died."
    DeathEvent.Beach.General2: "m_c was lost to the sea while trying to save r_c from drowning."
    DeathEvent.Beach.General3: "m_c died from dehydration and heat stroke."
    DeathEvent.Beach.General4: "m_c found {PRONOUN/m_c/self} staring at an odd shadow in the sea. One distracted paw slipped and {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} fell into the waves where something large and unseen tangled around {PRONOUN/m_c/object}, dragging {PRONOUN/m_c/object} into the abyss. "
    DeathEvent.Beach.General5: "m_c drowned after being pushed out to sea by o_c warriors."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Kitten0: "m_c died from dehydration and heat stroke."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Leader0: "m_c lost a life when {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} fell from the top branches of a tree."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Leader1: "m_c was washed out to sea, never to be seen again."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Leader2: "m_c was lost to the sea while trying to save r_c from drowning."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Leader3: "m_c was pushed off a cliff into the rock-filled waves below. r_c stood at the edge, eyes narrowed and unblinking till the body slid beneath the waves."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Leader4: "m_c was pushed off a cliff into the rock-filled waves below. r_c insists it was an accident, that m_c slipped on loose shale."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Leader5: "Usually m_c is well aware of when the high tide will come in, but today {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} distracted and run ragged with Clan business. Trapped against the cliffs with treacherous waves pulling at {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} paws, the last thing {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/see/sees} is the smug grin of r_c sat high above on the rocks."
    DeathEvent.Beach.Leader6: "m_c saves one of the Clan's kits from drowning, but loses a life in the process. The kit is well scolded for straying into the water, but is even more subdued than expected afterwards; sending nervous glances at r_c that no one else seems to catch."
    
    # Forest
    DeathEvent.Forest.General0: "m_c was killed by a falling branch during a battle in a heavily wooded area of the forest."
    DeathEvent.Forest.General1: "m_c agreed to venture with r_c out onto a frozen pond. m_c went first while r_c hung back. m_c slid around playfully, taunting the other cat to chase {PRONOUN/m_c/object}. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/were/was} about to launch another teasing remark when the ice cracked below {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} paws. r_c lingered to make sure {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} didn't surface before running back to camp with a yowl."
    DeathEvent.Forest.General2: "m_c and r_c talked each other into walking onto the ice of the frozen pond that lay not far from camp. It was a dare at first, but when m_c didn't immediately fall in, r_c joined {PRONOUN/m_c/object}. The two cats playfully slipped around for a bit before the minute cracks reached their ears. By then, it was too late to move."

    DeathEvent.Forest.Kitten1: "m_c froze to death during a harsh snowstorm."

    DeathEvent.Forest.Kitten5: "m_c wandered away from camp in the night, never to be seen again."
    DeathEvent.Forest.Kitten6: "m_c vanished from camp after sneaking out, and the search parties find nothing but blood."
    DeathEvent.Forest.Kitten7: "m_c is found within a few fox-lengths of camp, {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} tiny body cold and covered in bites. The scent of mouse hangs heavy in the air..."
    DeathEvent.Forest.Kitten8: "m_c can be heard boasting that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'{VERB/m_c/re/s} ready to be made an apprentice <i>right now</i>, and that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'{VERB/m_c/re/s} already one of the best hunters in the Clan. That evening, to prove {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} point, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} sneak out of camp, intending to catch something for the fresh-kill pile. A frantic search party follows {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} trail, only to find blood and the foul stench of a shrew at the end."
    DeathEvent.Forest.Leader0: "m_c lost a life after falling into a river."
    DeathEvent.Forest.Leader1: "m_c was crushed and lost a life when a tree fell into camp."

    DeathEvent.Apprentice5: "m_c enters {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} battle stance, staring down r_c, who wanted to assess the apprentice's skills. m_c dashes forward, getting in some hits on r_c's side, before scampering out of range. Feeling bolder, the apprentice goes in for another attack from the other side. r_c spins around at the last second, {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} claws catching m_c across the throat."

    DeathEvent.Deputy2: "A yowl took m_c by surprise as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was} patrolling the territory. r_c suddenly crashed into view, meowing about how m_c had to come and see. m_c followed the distressed warrior to a small ravine. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} peered over the edge, and noted the sharp rocks at the bottom. Suddenly, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} felt a sharp shove from behind, letting out a yowl of surprise that was cut short as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} landed on the rocks."

Frantic with worry and confusion after finding m_c's empty nest in the morning, c_n launches a search. They find {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} cooling body after a long search and wonders why {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} decided to leave the safety of c_n, and what killed {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."

    DeathGriefMinor1: "As the vigil draws to a close, someone suggests r_c should eat. It feels like dung in {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} mouth, but {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/know/knows} m_c would want {PRONOUN/r_c/object} to take care of {PRONOUN/r_c/self}."
    DeathGriefMinor2: "r_c keeps searching for tasks to do, cats to comfort, distractions against the hole in {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} heart, as {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/fight/fights} to keep the grief from consuming {PRONOUN/r_c/object}."
    DeathGriefMinor3: "The world seems dim and lifeless, and r_c keeps close to {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} Clan, seeking out their comfort and company."
    DeathGriefMinor4: "r_c goes over the best of the moments {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} shared with m_c in {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} mind, again and again, until {PRONOUN/r_c/subject}{VERB/r_c/'re/'s} certain {PRONOUN/r_c/subject}'ll remember m_c forever."
    DeathGriefMinor5: "One day, the Clan will have kittens who never knew m_c in life, but r_c vows to ensure m_c's memory will live on through {PRONOUN/r_c/object}."
    DeathGriefMinor6: "Some of the memories shared at m_c's vigil make r_c laugh. Some cry. Most of them do both, as r_c marvels at what a special cat m_c was."
    DeathGriefMinor7: "r_c wonders if, maybe, if {PRONOUN/r_c/subject}{VERB/r_c/'re/'s} lucky, m_c might visit {PRONOUN/r_c/object} in a vision from StarClan."
    DeathGriefMinor8: "r_c curls tightly in {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest once the vigil comes to a close, throat raw from crying. Miserably, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/dwell/dwells} on how m_c won't see another morning."
    DeathGriefMinor9: "r_c makes a point of removing some foliage from m_c's nest before it's cleared out. m_c's scent, and the strands of fur left behind, comforts r_c as {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/drift/drifts} to sleep that night."
    DeathGriefMinor10: "As r_c's Clanmates comfort {PRONOUN/r_c/object} during the vigil, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} can't help but wonder if things will ever feel normal again without m_c in {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} life."
    DeathGriefMinor11: "r_c rubs {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} eyes wearily, gazing up into the vast sky. Perhaps m_c has already found {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} way to StarClan, and {PRONOUN/r_c/subject}'ll spot a new star in Silverpelt tonight."
    DeathGriefMinor12: "r_c's body feels heavy with exhaustion. Still, though, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} sluggishly {VERB/r_c/amble/ambles} around camp, hoping somehow, somewhere, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject}'d find m_c alive, well, and happy."
    DeathGriefMinor13: "r_c knew m_c might not always be with {PRONOUN/r_c/object}, but it wasn't supposed to be so soon. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/r_c/visit/visits} m_c's grave, bittersweetly recalling all the happy memories they shared."
    DeathGriefMinor14: "r_c tosses and turns, finding it difficult to sleep with {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} thoughts lingering on m_c's last moments. r_c can only hope m_c knew how loved {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was}."
    DeathGriefMinor15: "r_c can't help the way {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} voice cracks while recalling m_c's life at the vigil. Even so, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/force/forces} a smile, knowing m_c would want a celebratory memorial."
    DeathGriefMinor16: "r_c can't handle the vigil's entirety, despite {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} best efforts. m_c's death has drained {PRONOUN/r_c/object}. r_c settles into {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest in a tight ball, hoping m_c might visit in a dream."
    DeathGriefMajor0: "r_c can't be bothered to get up out of {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest the next day, refusing to speak a word to those around {PRONOUN/r_c/object}."
    DeathGriefMajor1: "As the vigil draws to a close, someone suggests r_c should eat. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/r_c/refuse/refuses}, not so much as shifting {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} vacant gaze."
    DeathGriefMajor2: "When no one needs anything from {PRONOUN/r_c/object}, r_c breaks down, wailing uncontrollably and cursing the world that took m_c instead of {PRONOUN/r_c/object}."
    DeathGriefMajor3: "In the days to come, r_c barely stirs from {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest."
    DeathGriefMajor4: "As the days pass, r_c becomes angry and withdrawn. It feels like the entire Clan is just moving on from m_c's death, which {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/refuse/refuses} to do."
    DeathGriefMajor5: "Cats come to r_c afterwards, offering {PRONOUN/r_c/object} the biggest, juiciest pieces of fresh-kill, but {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/refuse/refuses} it all, staring at the walls of {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} den in silence."
    DeathGriefMajor6: "Things are never going to be the same now. Could never be the same. r_c doesn't understand how life is supposed to just go on without m_c. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/r_c/refuse/refuses} to accept it."
    DeathGriefMajor7: "r_c spends time by {PRONOUN/r_c/self}, letting {PRONOUN/r_c/self} mourn m_c and the time they should have had together. No one can begrudge {PRONOUN/r_c/object} the need to grieve."
    DeathGriefMajor8: "Cats offer r_c comfort and care. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/r_c/refuse/refuses} all of it."
    DeathGriefMajor9: "r_c only retires to {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest when concerned Clanmates usher them there. Tremors wrack through {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} body, as {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/dwell/dwells} on how m_c won't see another morning."
    DeathGriefMajor10: "r_c makes a point of removing foliage from m_c's nest, snapping at any hindrance. {PRONOUN/r_c/poss/CAP} paws tremble over the material, distraught when {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/realize/realizes} how fast m_c's scent is fading."
    DeathGriefMajor11: "Nobody can comfort r_c during the vigil; {PRONOUN/r_c/subject}{VERB/r_c/'re/'s} absolutely inconsolable, convinced that {PRONOUN/r_c/subject}'ll never feel normal again without m_c beside {PRONOUN/r_c/object}."
    DeathGriefMajor12: "In the dead of the night, r_c wails into the vast sky, unable to fathom StarClan's cruelty. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/r_c/glare/glares} up at Silverpelt, gouging the earth with shaky claws."
    DeathGriefMajor13: "r_c is barely able to move {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} body, and has to be gently guided to {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest, fatigue threatening to consume {PRONOUN/r_c/object}."
    DeathGriefMajor14: "Once night comes, and {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/fall/falls} asleep, r_c desperately wails m_c's name, movements frantic as {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/struggle/struggles} - no, {VERB/r_c/refuse/refuses} - to accept {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} death."
    DeathGriefMajor15: "r_c never considered the possibility that {PRONOUN/r_c/subject}'d one day be without m_c. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/r_c/visit/visits} {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} grave, gazing blankly, unmovingly, at the ground for hours on end."
    DeathGriefMajor16: "r_c trembles, tearing at {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest, unable to sleep as {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/brood/broods} over m_c's last moments. Did {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} suffer? {VERB/r_c/Were/Was} {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} scared? r_c can't shake the crushing guilt."
    DeathGriefMajor17: "r_c can't help {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} bitterness and rage as m_c's life is recalled at the vigil. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} coldly {VERB/r_c/turn/turns} away any who offer comfort. Without m_c, what's the point?"
    DeathGriefMajor18: "r_c can't handle the vigil's entirety. It's far too agonizing. The loss has taken such a toll on {PRONOUN/r_c/object} that {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} can barely find {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} footing as {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/stumble/stumbles} to {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest, wailing for m_c."
