    # Gained Congenital Conditions 
    ConditionGain.BornWithoutALeg0: "m_c mewls, snuggling up to {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} parent as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} anxiously {VERB/m_c/await/awaits} the verdict, but r_c is confident that m_c's lack of a leg won't slow {PRONOUN/m_c/object} down, and the new family is left to bond, relieved and purring."
    ConditionGain.BornWithoutALeg1: "It's immediately clear that m_c might take longer to find {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} feet - {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'ve/'s} been born without one of the usual set."
    ConditionGain.WeakLeg0: "As m_c toddles around the nursery, r_c watches and m_c's parent waits in suspense. Finally, r_c nods, and confirms that one of m_c's legs isn't developing at the same rate as the others."
    ConditionGain.WeakLeg1: "m_c keeps falling to one side, and eventually it's clear that one of the legs on that side just isn't as strong as the others."
    ConditionGain.TwistedLeg0: "r_c examines m_c as {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} parent holds {PRONOUN/m_c/object} by the scruff, checking on a leg that is becoming twisted as the kit grows."
    ConditionGain.TwistedLeg1: "When m_c tries to toddle around, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/seem/seems} to be slower than {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} siblings. A quick inspection reveals that one of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} legs was born twisted and deformed, but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} should find {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} footing in life soon enough."
    ConditionGain.BornWithoutATail0: "m_c is healthy, r_c confirms, but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} simply {VERB/m_c/haven't/hasn't} been born with a tail."
    ConditionGain.BornWithoutATail1: "m_c is fluffy and full of yelling and the want for milk, but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll never be able to lash {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} tail like the other kittens, having been born without one."
    ConditionGain.Paralyzed0: "r_c soothes m_c's frantically worried parent - their kit will never walk, but it's still possible for {PRONOUN/m_c/object} to have a happy, healthy life."
    ConditionGain.Paralyzed1: "It's immediately clear that m_c can't feel {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} hindlegs when {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} born, but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/seem/seems} like a happy bundle of newborn fluff anyway."
    ConditionGain.RaspyLungs0: "m_c has been having a lot of trouble keeping up while playing. r_c listens to {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} chest, and diagnoses {PRONOUN/m_c/object} as having raspy lungs."
    ConditionGain.RaspyLungs1: "As m_c grows, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/seem/seems} incapable of not snoring and panting loudly, until eventually it's clear {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} lungs are a little weaker than normal."
    ConditionGain.WastingDisease0: "r_c has been called in by m_c's worried parent, and unfortunately that worry was well-founded, as m_c seems to have wasting disease."
    ConditionGain.WastingDisease1: "m_c seems weaker, lately, unable to play as much or explore as far."
    ConditionGain.WastingDisease2: "m_c is a sickly kit and the Clan fears {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} may not live past kithood. Even if {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/do/does}, this sickness may never leave {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ConditionGain.Blind0: "m_c has never had any trouble getting around, but one day {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/ask/asks} a strange question about how someone knew someone else was napping on the other side of camp, and r_c realizes {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} blind."
    ConditionGain.Blind1: "m_c fits in perfectly at first, but as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/grow/grows} and open {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes, it becomes clear that to m_c there's no difference between having {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes closed or open."
    ConditionGain.OneBadEye0: "Spotting m_c stumbling over something on {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} right side, r_c brings {PRONOUN/m_c/object} to the medicine cat den, where it becomes clear that eye isn't working as normal."
    ConditionGain.OneBadEye1: "m_c has become good at not letting things approaching on {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} bad side startle {PRONOUN/m_c/object}, except it turns out that's not a normal universal experience for a kitten to have."
    ConditionGain.FailingEyesight0: "When m_c complains how dark it's been recently, r_c checks {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyesight over - only to find it near gone."
    ConditionGain.FailingEyesight1: "m_c doesn't understand how everyone else seems to see so far - and is sad to find out {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyesight is failing."
    ConditionGain.PartialHearingLoss0: "r_c is called in to assess m_c's hearing, and while it's still present, m_c definitely isn't hearing clearly."
    ConditionGain.PartialHearingLoss1: "m_c keeps asking cats to repeat themselves, until it's clear that something about {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} hearing is weak and unreliable."
    ConditionGain.Deaf0: "When most kittens are learning to talk, m_c seems delayed. r_c is called, and {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/report/reports} that while m_c will live life just fine, it appears {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'ve/'s} never been able to hear."
    ConditionGain.Deaf1: "m_c isn't bothered by being deaf, though the Clan seems to want to comfort {PRONOUN/m_c/object} when everyone finds out that's why learning to talk has been so hard."
    ConditionGain.ConstantJointPain0: "m_c's worried parent calls in r_c after weeks of constant pain. r_c can provide pain relief, but it's possible this may be a constant in m_c's life."
    ConditionGain.ConstantJointPain1: "m_c refuses once again to go out and play, {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} joints swollen and painful. It's becoming clear that it's not an isolated instance, and m_c might need some help."
    ConditionGain.SeizureProne0: "r_c wakes m_c slowly. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP}{VERB/m_c/'ve/'s} had a seizure, and are in the medicine cat den just while {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/recover/recovers}, r_c explains. It might happen again in the future, and m_c needs to be prepared."
    ConditionGain.SeizureProne1: "In the middle of camp, right as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} about to pounce, m_c falls to the ground and begins shaking, a seizure rolling through {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} little body."
    ConditionGain.Allergies0: "m_c sneezes again, {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} frantic parent yowling about whitecough, but r_c calms everyone down. It's only allergies, and {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/have/has} just the herbs to help."
    ConditionGain.Allergies1: "In the middle of playing, m_c sneezes so hard {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/fall/falls} over. Again. This is really becoming a pattern."
    ConditionGain.PersistentHeadaches0: "r_c notices with some concern that any time m_c opens {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/mewl/mewls} incessantly and try to wriggle into the darkest corners of the medicine cat den. r_c suspects {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} may have chronic headaches."
    ConditionGain.PersistentHeadaches1: "Rather than go outside in the bright sunlight to play with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} littermates, m_c prefers to huddle by {PRONOUN/m_c/self} in the dark and quiet of the medicine cat den, {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} head hurting too much to move."

    # Gained Permenant Conditions
    ConditionGain.BrokenJaw.CrookedJaw0: "Despite r_c's best efforts, m_c's jaw is healing crooked. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} just glad it's healing at all."
    ConditionGain.BrokenJaw.CrookedJaw1: "r_c tells m_c that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} jaw will never be aligned correctly again, but healing from a broken jaw at all is a miracle."
    ConditionGain.BrokenJaw.CrookedJaw2: "m_c has been feeling the pain in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} broken jaw lessen, but {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} teeth just don't fit together neatly like they used to."
    ConditionGain.BrokenJaw.CrookedJaw3: "m_c can finally chew without pain, but it seems {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} jaw is permanently crooked now."
    ConditionGain.BrokenJaw.CrookedJaw4: "While m_c is glad that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} jaw is finally healed, it's still frustrating that it's now permanently twisted."
    ConditionGain.BrokenBone.WeakLeg0: "m_c has been impatient, and r_c has noticed {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/have/has}n't been the most diligent with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leg strengthening exercises. It's unfortunately having consequences, as {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} healing broken bone has given {PRONOUN/m_c/object} a weaker leg."
    ConditionGain.BrokenBone.WeakLeg1: "r_c examines m_c's leg and reports that everything seems to be healed, the weakness that m_c has complained about is likely a permanent consequence of the injury."
    ConditionGain.BrokenBone.WeakLeg2: "m_c pads along on all four legs for the first time in a long time, wincing. {PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} healed broken bone has definitely left the leg weaker, but it's manageable as far as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} concerned."
    ConditionGain.BrokenBone.WeakLeg3: "m_c can't run as long or as quickly as before, but {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} glad that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leg healed at all."
    ConditionGain.BrokenBone.TwistedLeg0: "r_c considers m_c's leg. It might be possible to re-break it, but it will likely always heal twisted after this. Instead, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/leave/leaves} it as it's healing."
    ConditionGain.BrokenBone.TwistedLeg1: "The damage to m_c's leg was simply too great and while it has managed to heal, r_c tells m_c that it will always be twisted at an odd angle."
    ConditionGain.BrokenBone.TwistedLeg2: "{PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} broken bone has healed twisted, but m_c is just so glad to be free of the boredom of recovery."
    ConditionGain.BrokenBone.TwistedLeg3: "Twisted is better than gone, is what m_c tells {PRONOUN/m_c/self}. Broken legs can be deadly and m_c is lucky to still be alive."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.LostALeg0: "The leg is too mangled - r_c sighs, and prepares the poppy seeds to knock m_c out while it's removed."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.LostALeg1: "When m_c wakes up from {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} poppy seed induced sleep, r_c breaks the news that m_c's leg had to be removed."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.LostALeg2: "m_c wakes up one leg less than {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} went to sleep with, and it's both upsetting and a relief. {PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} leg was so mangled, and m_c in so much pain, that this might be for the best. But it's still a loss."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.LostALeg3: "The damage to m_c's leg has turned out to be too great and {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leg had to be removed for any hope of recovery."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.LostALeg4: "m_c has healed from {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mangled leg, but the leg had to be removed completely."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.WeakLeg0: "r_c tells m_c that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} might have to accept that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leg that was so badly mangled will always now be weaker. At least {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} still {VERB/m_c/have/has} it, but that's cold consolation to m_c, who feels like {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was} so close to healing perfectly."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.WeakLeg1: "r_c explains to m_c that the weakness {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/feel/feels} in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leg will likely always be present, a consequence of the severe damage."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.WeakLeg2: "m_c stands triumphantly on a leg that, while it'll always be weaker than {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} others, now works only a little worse than before. It's been a long journey to heal such a badly injured limb."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.WeakLeg3: "m_c limps around the camp, happy to at least be up and moving, though the new limp is probably permanent."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.TwistedLeg0: "m_c tells r_c it's fine, and {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/know/knows} r_c did {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} best. {PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} leg was too badly mangled, to heal this far is a miracle from StarClan, even if it is twisted."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.TwistedLeg1: "m_c's leg has healed but r_c has to explain that it will always be awkwardly twisted and uncomfortable to walk with.  Sometimes herbs can only do so much."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.TwistedLeg2: "{PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} twisted limb frustrates {PRONOUN/m_c/object} constantly, but m_c tells {PRONOUN/m_c/self} it could've been worse, and that at least {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} still there to feel irritated by it."
    ConditionGain.MangledLeg.TwistedLeg3: "m_c has to hold {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} healed, but twisted, limb up near to {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} body as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/hop/hops} around camp. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} survived {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} injury but the leg will never comfortably support {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} weight."
    ConditionGain.DislocatedJoint.ConstantJointPain0: "It feels like {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} formerly dislocated joint just isn't the same anymore. r_c is understanding, but prepares m_c for the possibility that this could be permanent."
    ConditionGain.DislocatedJoint.ConstantJointPain1: "r_c explains to m_c that dislocating a joint can have permanent consequences. The pain m_c is feeling could be permanent."
    ConditionGain.DislocatedJoint.ConstantJointPain2: "m_c needs pain relief far more often these days, the joint {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} dislocated giving {PRONOUN/m_c/object} trouble."
    ConditionGain.MangledTail.LostTheirTail0: "r_c helps m_c bury {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} tail wordlessly, hoping the ritual brings {PRONOUN/m_c/object} closure to the trauma of losing it."
    ConditionGain.MangledTail.LostTheirTail1: "When m_c wakes up, r_c has to explain to {PRONOUN/m_c/object} that {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} removed m_c's tail as a last resort. The damage was too great."
    ConditionGain.MangledTail.LostTheirTail2: "It's okay, m_c tells {PRONOUN/m_c/self}. A tail isn't the worst thing to lose, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} going to be fine! But {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} still {VERB/m_c/feel/feels} its absence no matter how hard {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/try/tries} to force it from {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mind."
    ConditionGain.MangledTail.LostTheirTail3: "m_c has healed from {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mangled tail, but unfortunately the tail itself is gone."
    ConditionGain.TornEar.PartialHearingLoss0: "r_c continues {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} test, but it's clear that m_c's hearing isn't what it used to be, probably related to {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ear injury."
    ConditionGain.TornEar.PartialHearingLoss1: "r_c informs m_c that though {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ear has healed from its tear, there was still permanent damage done. m_c will struggle to hear out of that ear for the rest of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} life."
    ConditionGain.TornEar.PartialHearingLoss2: "m_c realizes that it's not that the camp has been more peaceful lately - {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} just can't hear as much as {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} used to."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.LostALeg0: "m_c doesn't want to look at {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leg. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} can no longer feel it at all and it's starting to produce a smell - obviously dead flesh. r_c says that it's probably best to remove it now before it gets worse, and m_c can't help but agree."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.LostALeg1: "r_c tells m_c that the frostbite is far too severe. The leg will have to be removed completely."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.LostALeg2: "m_c awakes with one less leg than {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} went to sleep with. Admittedly, it's more of a relief than anything. {PRONOUN/m_c/poss/CAP} dead, frostbitten flesh no longer had any feeling left anyway."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.LostTheirTail0: "m_c sighs sadly as r_c suggests that it's time to take {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} tail off. The flesh is blackened from frostbite and is obviously dead - there's no use in leaving it attached. m_c agrees."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.LostTheirTail1: "m_c's tail can hardly even move and r_c tells {PRONOUN/m_c/object} that the frostbite has progressed too far. If m_c is to survive then the tail will have to be removed."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.LostTheirTail2: "m_c's tail is finally gone. It was more of a relief than anything. The frostbitten flesh was already dead and blackened, so {PRONOUN/m_c/object} had no issue with taking it off before it fell off on its own."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.PartialHearingLoss0: "r_c tells m_c that the frostbite had simply progressed too far into {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ear; {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} hearing is permanently damaged."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.PartialHearingLoss1: "m_c concentrates, trying hard to hear the soft whispers of r_c, but it's barely audible at all. r_c shakes {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} head and tells m_c, in a louder voice, that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} hearing was definitely damaged by the frostbite."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.PartialHearingLoss2: "Ever since {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ears were frostbit, m_c has struggled to hear clearly."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.Deaf0: "m_c does {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} best to communicate to r_c with rudimentary tail signals that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} hearing is permanently damaged, the frostbite having damaged something deep within."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.Deaf1: "m_c watches as r_c talks to another cat in the medicine den, glancing towards {PRONOUN/m_c/object} every so often. m_c can't hear a word they're saying. Truthfully, m_c can't hear anything at all anymore. The frostbite was more severe than {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} realized."
    ConditionGain.Frostbite.Deaf2: "m_c sits and watches the Clan going about their business and tries to get used to the stark silence. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/know/knows}, instinctively, that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} hearing is never coming back. The frostbite must have scarred something deep within {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} ears."
    ConditionGain.WaterInTheirLungs.RaspyLungs0: "r_c put a bunch of fragrant herbs under m_c's nose, hoping the scent will help the rasp in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} throat {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'ve/'s} had since inhaling water, unfortunately it seems this rasp may never leave."
    ConditionGain.WaterInTheirLungs.RaspyLungs1: "The damage to m_c's lungs is permanent and r_c gives {PRONOUN/m_c/object} strict instructions about not overexerting {PRONOUN/m_c/self}."
    ConditionGain.WaterInTheirLungs.RaspyLungs2: "Ever since {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} almost drowned, m_c's lungs haven't felt right."
    ConditionGain.SevereBurn.LostTheirTail0: "m_c makes a weak, very bad joke about {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} tail smelling like Twoleg food. Gently, r_c breaks the news that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} burned flesh is going to need to be removed."
    ConditionGain.SevereBurn.LostTheirTail1: "m_c's tail was almost completely taken by the fire, r_c tells {PRONOUN/m_c/object} that at this point it would be better to cleanly remove what still remains."
    ConditionGain.SevereBurn.LostTheirTail2: "m_c is almost glad to be rid of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} burned tail, which had long since ceased to feel like a real part of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} body except for the pain. Almost."
    ConditionGain.SevereBurn.LostALeg0: "As m_c sleeps under poppyseed influence, r_c prepares for the grim task of removing {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} burned leg, before the festering illness in it can spread to the rest of {PRONOUN/m_c/object}."
    ConditionGain.SevereBurn.LostALeg1: "r_c informs m_c that the harsh burn has rendered {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leg nearly useless. It will be better in the long run to remove the limb entirely."
    ConditionGain.SevereBurn.LostALeg2: "m_c feels almost guilty, but the absence of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} leg is just so much less painful then how it felt while burned that it's impossible not to be relieved."
    ConditionGain.SevereBurn.OneBadEye0: "r_c peels the cobwebs away from m_c's face and holds back a wince. The eye is unsalvageable and the rest of the skin will likely never grow fur again."
    ConditionGain.SevereBurn.OneBadEye1: "m_c can only be glad {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was} able to heal from the devastating burn, though {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} can't help but feel angry at {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} now vastly limited vision."
    ConditionGain.LingeringShock.RecurringShock0: "m_c demands to know when {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll stop freezing in fear at what {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/know/knows} are just memories. r_c doesn't have answers, but {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/comfort/comforts} {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} Clanmate, saying that forcing {PRONOUN/m_c/self} to be okay is just hurting m_c."
    ConditionGain.LingeringShock.RecurringShock1: "r_c tells m_c that {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/have/has} no way to stop dreams or memories, only poppy seeds to help r_c sleep. Perhaps the memories will fade with time."
    ConditionGain.LingeringShock.RecurringShock2: "m_c jumps, then realizes that it was just a leaf blowing in the wind. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP} {VERB/m_c/feel/feels} exhausted, and {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} memories feel like a trap that rears up to bite {PRONOUN/m_c/object} whenever {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/relax/relaxes}."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.FailingEyesight0: "m_c tells r_c that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} vision seems to be growing blurrier and blurrier by the day. r_c looks worried at the news."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.FailingEyesight1: "r_c tests m_c's eyesight one day, asking {PRONOUN/m_c/object} to follow r_c's tail with {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes. m_c struggles with the task and r_c tells {PRONOUN/m_c/object} it may be a permanent consequence of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} head injury."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.FailingEyesight2: "m_c only seems to grow more disoriented, despite {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} head injury seeming to be fully healed. It seems {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} vision is blurry and slightly doubled now, {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}'ll have to find a way to adjust."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.OneBadEye0: "m_c waits a few days before telling r_c, hoping that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} vision will come back on it's own. It doesn't, however, and {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} begrudgingly {VERB/m_c/admit/admits} to r_c that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/have/has}n't been able to see out of one eye ever since {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was} hit in the head."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.OneBadEye1: "m_c begins to practice moving around camp, trying to get used to the lack of depth perception that {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} vision loss is causing."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.Blind0: "The knock to {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} head has blinded {PRONOUN/m_c/object}. r_c tells m_c {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} vision will never return. Something in {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} eyes must have been damaged by the blow."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.Blind1: "m_c hasn't been able to see clearly since {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} {VERB/m_c/were/was} hit in the head, and it only gets worse by the day. Eventually r_c breaks the news that {PRONOUN/m_c/subject}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} going blind."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.Blind2: "m_c stumbles through camp, trying {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} best to learn the layout. It seems like {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} head injury has made {PRONOUN/m_c/object} go blind and {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} vision doesn't seem to be returning any time soon."
    ConditionGain.HeadDamage.ConstantlyDizzy0: "m_c stumbles through the medicine den, trying to walk a straight line as r_c instructed. r_c tells {PRONOUN/m_c/object} that the newfound lack of balance might be a permanent result of {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} head injury."
